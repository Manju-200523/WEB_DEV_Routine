# WebDev Practice Routine

This repository is a **daily web development practice journal**.  
The idea is simple: each day, add a new folder with your work, exercises, or experiments, and commit it to the repository. Over time, this will grow into a complete collection of practical web development exercises.

## Purpose

- Encourage daily learning and practice in web development.
- Keep track of progress in an organized, structured way.
- Serve as a personal portfolio of consistent coding practice.

## How to Contribute

1. Create a new folder for each day (e.g., `day3`, `day4`, etc.).
2. Add your work for the day inside that folder.
3. Commit and push changes:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Added day3 practice"
git push
